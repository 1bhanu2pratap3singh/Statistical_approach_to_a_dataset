# Statistical_approach_to_a_dataset
In this, we will apply many topics related to statistical (inferential and Descriptive)
some of the issues include 
---descriptive approach 
The measure of Central tendency – represents the center or average of mean, median, and mode.
The measure of Dispersion/variability– measures of the spread of the data like range, variance, and standard deviaƟon.
Estimates of frequency distribuƟon - talks about the occurrence of data within the dataset.
---Inferential Statistics
PopulaƟon – the enƟre group of individuals or events.
Sample -the subset of the population that is selected to gather information and make inferences
about the population.
Sampling Techniques – techniques used are random sampling, straƟfied sampling, or cluster
sampling.
Hypothesis tesƟng - A staƟsƟcal procedure to make a claim about a population based on the
inferences on the sample we form null and alternate hypotheses.
Confidence interval – a range of values calculated from sample data that provides an
esƟmate of the populaƟon parameter with a certain level of confidence.
Significance level – threshold used to determine if the results of a hypothesis test are
statically significant. It represents the probability of observing a result more extreme than
the one obtained if the null hypothesis is true.
